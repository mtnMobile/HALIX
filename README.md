# HALIX
A MD file to assist in AI work for iOS developers working in both UIKit and SwiftUI code bases.

This is my personal fork of the original  
[SwiftAgents project by Paul Hudson](https://github.com/twostraws/SwiftAgents).

Paul’s work provided the foundation and direction for this version, and I’m grateful for his original design and ideas. This fork explores some alternative patterns, refinements, and additions that reflect my own preferences and experimentation.

### Helpful Tooling for New Apple APIs

When working with bleeding-edge Apple frameworks that LLMs haven’t been trained on yet (such as Liquid Glass), one tool has been especially valuable: **[llm.codes](https://llm.codes)**. It generates clean, LLM-ready text files directly from Apple’s official documentation, allowing agents to work with up-to-date APIs that aren’t yet part of any model’s training data.

This is a great service is offered by **Peter Steinberger ([@steipete](https://twitter.com/steipete))**.  You can find more of his writing, insights, and tools on his blog: **https://steipete.me/**
