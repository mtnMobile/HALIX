# HALIX
A MD file to assist in AI work for iOS developers working in both UIKit and SwiftUI code bases.

This is my personal fork of the original  
[SwiftAgents project by Paul Hudson](https://github.com/twostraws/SwiftAgents).

Paul’s work provided the foundation and direction for this version, and I’m grateful for his original design and ideas. This fork explores some alternative patterns, refinements, and additions that reflect my own preferences and experimentation.

I would also like to add a tool I've used a lot that is a huge asset when you're working with new Apple API that no LLM has been trained on.  This proved invaluable for me when working with Liquid Glass changes in a legacy code base.
